# Simple Queue System

This is a simple, robust queue management system built with Rust. It provides an operator interface for managing a queue, a public-facing signage display for real-time status, and text-to-speech (TTS) functionality for announcements. The system is designed for easy deployment using Docker or Podman.

## Features

- **Operator Interface**: A web-based panel for operators to add new calls to the queue, skip calls, and manually trigger announcements.
- **Signage Display**: A public display that shows the currently served call number and location, along with histories of recent and skipped calls.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Automatically generates audio announcements for calls in multiple languages. It includes a caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce external API calls.
- **Announcement Management**: Supports automated and manual cycling of pre-recorded audio and banner announcements, with configurable cooldowns to prevent spamming.
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to provide instant updates to all connected clients (operators and signage displays) without needing to refresh the page.
- **Docker/Podman Support**: Containerized for easy, consistent, and isolated deployment across different environments.
- **Multi-Arch Builds**: The application is automatically built and pushed as a multi-architecture Docker image (amd64, arm64, armv7), making it suitable for a wide range of devices, including Raspberry Pi.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Docker or Podman must be installed on your system.

### Deployment

You can run the system using a single command. The container image is publicly available on the GitHub Container Registry.

**Using Docker:**
```bash
docker run -d \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --name queue-system \
    ghcr.io/ledokun/028-simple-queue-system:latest
```

**Using Podman:**
```bash
podman run -d \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --name queue-system \
    ghcr.io/ledokun/028-simple-queue-system:latest
```

Once running, you can access the interfaces at:

- **Landing Page**: http://localhost:3000
- **Operator Panel**: http://localhost:3000/operator.html
- **Signage Display**: http://localhost:3000/signage.html

## Environment Variables

The system can be configured using the following environment variables. You can pass them to the docker run command using the `-e` flag (e.g., `-e RUST_LOG=debug`).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | Logging level for the application. Can be set to debug, warn, etc. |
| `SERVER_ADDRESS` | `0.0.0.0` | The IP address for the server to bind to. |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `3000` | The port for the server to listen on. |
| `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` | `5` | Maximum number of completed calls to store in the history. |
| `MAX_SKIPPED_HISTORY_SIZE` | `5` | Maximum number of skipped calls to store in the history. |
| `SERVE_DIR_PATH` | `./public` | Path to the directory containing static web files. |
| `ANNOUNCEMENTS_SUB_PATH` | `media/audios_and_banners` | Sub-path within SERVE_DIR_PATH where announcement audio and banner files are located. |
| `ANNOUNCEMENT_AUTO_CYCLE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `1200` | Interval (in seconds) for automatically cycling announcements. Set to 0 to disable. |
| `ANNOUNCEMENT_MANUAL_TRIGGER_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `60` | Cooldown period (in seconds) after manually triggering an announcement. |
| `GTTS_CACHE_BASE_PATH` | `/tmp/gtts_audio_cache` | Base path for caching generated TTS audio files. |
| `TTS_CACHE_MAXIMUM_FILES` | `500` | Maximum number of TTS audio files to keep in the cache. |
| `TTS_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `15` | Timeout (in seconds) for external TTS service requests. |
| `TTS_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` | `th:Thai,en-uk:British English` | Comma-separated list of supported languages for TTS (format: code:Name). |
| `SSE_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `15` | Interval (in seconds) for sending SSE keep-alive messages. |
| `SSE_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE` | `200` | Size of the buffer for SSE events. |
| `TTS_CACHE_WEB_PATH` | `/tts_cache` | Web path where the TTS cache is accessible. |

## Automated Docker Image Builds

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically build and push a multi-architecture Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) on every push to the main branch.
